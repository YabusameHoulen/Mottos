    To a mathematician's eye, some physics textbooks are chock-full of somewhat imprecise statesments made about rather ill-defined quantities. It is not rare that those statesments are simply untrue if taken at face value. Moreover arguments full of implicit assumptions are presented in the most authoritative manner.

    In this drama of mathematics and physics --- which fertilize each other in the dark, but which prefer to deny and misconstrue each other face to face --- I cannot, however, resist playing the role of a messenger, albeit, as I have abundantly learned, often an unwelcome one.

    歐幾里得極為偏愛的歸謬法是數學家最好使的一種武器。 這是一種比象棋中任何開局謀略都更為精巧的謀略：棋手可能會犧牲一個兵或其他棋子來開局，而數學家犧牲的則是整個棋局。

    ...I have often ventured in my life to advance propositions of which I was not sure. But everything I have written there has been in my head for almost a year, and it is too much in my interest not to be mistaken for anyone to suspect me of having stated theorems of which I would not have the complete demonstration. You will publicly ask Jacobi and Gauss to give their opinion, not on the truth, but on the importance of the theorems. I kiss you with effusion.
