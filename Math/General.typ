    To a mathematician's eye, some physics textbooks are chock-full of somewhat imprecise statesments made about rather ill-defined quantities. It is not rare that those statesments are simply untrue if taken at face value. Moreover arguments full of implicit assumptions are presented in the most authoritative manner.

    In this drama of mathematics and physics --- which fertilize each other in the dark, but which prefer to deny and misconstrue each other face to face --- I cannot, however, resist playing the role of a messenger, albeit, as I have abundantly learned, often an unwelcome one.
