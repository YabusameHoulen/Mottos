    科學家不是因為有用才研究自然的。他們研究自然出於喜愛，他們喜愛是因為它美，假若大自然不是美的，則它的知識不值得追求，而人生也不值得過了...

    我指的是根源於自然各部分的和諧秩序、純理智能夠把握的內在美...正因為簡潔和浩瀚都是美的，所以我們優先尋求簡潔的事實和浩瀚的事實；所以我們追尋恆星的巨大軌道，用顯微鏡探察奇異的細小，在地質年代中追蹤過去的遺蹟

    The amount of theoretical ground one has to cover before being able to solve problems of real practical value is rather large, but this circumstance is an inevitable consequence of the fundamental part played by transformation theory and is likely to become more pronounced in the theoretical physics of the future.

    The effort to understand the Universe is one of the very few things that lifts human life above the level of farce, and gives it some of the grace of tragedy.

    The black holes of nature are the most perfect macroscopic objects there are in the universe: the only elements in their construction are our concepts of space and time. And since the general theory of relativity provides only a single unique family of solutions for their descriptions, they are the simplest objects as well.

    Physics (Everything) should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler. \

    It can scarcely be denied that the supreme goal of all theory is to make the irreducible basic elements as simple and as few as possible without having to surrender the adequate representation of a single datum of experience.
